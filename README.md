# BlazorDesk

Admin Console Desk made with blazor forked from AdminLte 3.0.5

## Why and how and special thanks

Why:
I want an Admin Console Desk for a product I'm working on. (October, 2020)
And I like Blazor which is potentially able to beat VUE which I don't have time to learn.
And I like the way how classical UserControls on windows work.

How:
I wanted to fork from Blazorized by Sjef van Leeuwen ( https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/blazor-adminlte ),
but I hoped it simpler.
Then I migrated the code from it and reorganized it into this project.

Special Thanks:
Original creator Sjef van Leeuwen [@sjefvanleeuwen](https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen)
